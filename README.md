# Exploring-LEGO-Dataset
I went go through the data model of the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset and then create a database for analytics and insights

In this Query, I went through real scenarios of answering questions about data with SQL. From basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions.
I worked on the following skills ;
- Creating a Database in SQL Server
- Two different methods of Importing Files into a Database
- SQL Joins
- SQL Window Functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
